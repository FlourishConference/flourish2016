He will demonstrate how we can use these language constructs to represent every discrete piece of functionality as an equally discrete model, view, and update function, and how to compose them to build larger applications out of smaller ones.\n We will see how the Elm architecture allows us to scale to any level of complexity with ease by building our applications as fractal structures with components fully contained by other components - not just their presentation,\n but their model and business logic as well.",

Unfortunately, pure functional programming still seems to have an overly-mathematical stigma in the front-end community that can be discouraging to newcomers. Elm aims to fix all of this.",
				"description2": "Elm is a pleasant compile-to-JS language that marries the productivity of the JavaScript environment with the productivity and guarantees of a functional language. In Elm, every value is immutable, every function is stateless and concise, every DOM update is virtual, and every app is guaranteed free from runtime exceptions. Additionally, it provides this power in a way that is accessible and easy for people who are new to functional programming to get started and become productive quickly.",

				"description1": "We define corporate open source (COS) as applying the precepts and methodologies prevalent in the open source development community for creating industrial-strength software projects in a corporation for internal use. It may seem that open source style development - using informal processes, voluntary assignment to tasks, and having few financial incentives - may not be a good match for commercial environments. Our work not only demonstrated that under the right circumstances corporations benefit from open source development techniques, but it also laid the groundwork for the research initiative now called \"Inner Source\", or the applications of best practices and culture from the open source domain applied to internal corporate software development efforts."
