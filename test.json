Compared to the traditional MVC architecture it can be described as MVU - Model, View, Update. Reactivity is a built-in construct in Elm and so Elm allows us to strip away all of the control associated with a controller and focus entirely on how we update the model given a change in our system.",
                    "description2": "In this talk Luke will explain how the Elm architecture arises from Elm's Signals, Tasks, Tagged Unions, and stateless view functions. He will demonstrate how we can use these language constructs to represent every discrete piece of functionality as an equally discrete model, view, and update function, and how to compose them to build larger applications out of smaller ones.
We will see how the Elm architecture allows us to scale to any level of complexity with ease by building our applications as fractal structures with components fully contained by other components - not just their presentation, but their model and business logic as well.",

The real benefit of functional programming, however, comes from using a truly functional language. Unfortunately, pure functional programming still seems to have an overly-mathematical stigma in the front-end community that can be discouraging to newcomers. Elm aims to fix all of this.",
                    "description2": "Elm is a pleasant compile-to-JS language that marries the productivity of the JavaScript environment with the productivity and guarantees of a functional language. In Elm, every value is immutable, every function is stateless and concise, every DOM update is virtual, and every app is guaranteed free from runtime exceptions. Additionally, it provides this power in a way that is accessible and easy for people who are new to functional programming to get started and become productive quickly.",
